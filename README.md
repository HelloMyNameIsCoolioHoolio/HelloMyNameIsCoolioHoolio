Hello, I am a beginner trying to learn programming. My current interests are Python and C#, with a bit of C++ too. I'm pretty much a noob in everything.
### Projects
* Spell Checker - 100% Python
* realest bot - 100% Python -- not listed in my repositories
* Future projects coming soon, probably in C# or Python
### Plans
* An app, haven't decided what it's going to be for, probably written in Kotlin
* Desktop app, a desktop version of the mobile app
* More Desktop Apps
